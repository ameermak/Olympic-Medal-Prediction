# Olympic-Medal-Prediction

In one of my early ventures into machine learning, I embarked on a project that combined my interest in data science with a passion for sports. The goal was to create an Olympic medal prediction system using tools like Python and Jupyter Notebook. I applied practical skills with Pandas for efficient data manipulation, NumPy for handling mathematical operations, Scikit-Learn for foundational machine learning, and Seaborn for visual representation.

I obtained Olympic data from Kaggle, focusing on predicting 'medals' based on key variables such as 'athletes' and 'previous medals.' I invested time in refining and cleaning the dataset to ensure its accuracy.

The model's effectiveness was measured using the Mean Absolute Error, highlighting successful outcomes, particularly in countries with a substantial athlete count. Concurrently, it pinpointed areas for improvement, especially in nations with fewer athletes. This dual insight reflects my dedication to continual learning and improvement in the dynamic field of machine learning.
