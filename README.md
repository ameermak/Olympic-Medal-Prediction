# Olympic-Medal-Prediction

This project seamlessly integrates my expertise in data science with a profound interest in sports, culminating in the development of an Olympic medal prediction system. Executed proficiently through the application of Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project encompasses a comprehensive skill set. Utilizing Pandas for efficient data frame manipulation, NumPy for intricate mathematical computations, Scikit-Learn for advanced machine learning, and Seaborn for sophisticated data visualization, the resulting ensemble epitomizes precision and proficiency.

The initiation of this endeavor involved the extraction of Olympic data from Kaggle, with a primary focus on predicting 'medals' as the coveted outcome. Key variables such as 'athletes' and 'previous medals' were identified as fundamental to the predictive model, laying the groundwork for subsequent analyses. Extensive efforts were dedicated to data exploration, ensuring meticulous refinement and cleansing processes were applied to maintain the dataset's integrity and accuracy.

To evaluate the model's efficacy, the Mean Absolute Error emerged as the benchmark, unveiling notable success, particularly in countries boasting a substantial athlete count. Simultaneously, this assessment highlighted opportunities for refinement, particularly in nations with fewer athletes. This dual revelation underscores a commitment to continuous improvement within the dynamic landscape of machine learning.

This README provides a succinct overview of the meticulously crafted Olympic medal prediction machine learning project. Reflecting both technical proficiency and a commitment to excellence, it serves as a testament to the intersection of data science expertise and a deep-seated interest in sports.
